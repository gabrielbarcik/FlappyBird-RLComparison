## Playing Flappy Bird Using Deep Q Learning DQN and Proximal Policy Optimization PPO

This repository aims to analyze and compare the performance of two agents based on PPO and DQN algorithms playing the popular game Flappy Bird. 

We have adapted an existing environment based on pygame() FlappyBird to the known RL library gym, developped by OpenAI. 

Our agents are based on the algorithms developped by openAI and made avaialable in the github of 'stable-baselines'.

Project under developpement.
